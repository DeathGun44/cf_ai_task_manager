## Initial Project Setup

### Prompt 1: Project Initialization
```
Create an AI-powered task management system using Cloudflare Workers with the following requirements:
- Use Workers AI with Llama 3.3 for natural language processing
- Implement Durable Objects for state management
- Include Vectorize for semantic search
- Support chat interface for task management
```

**Result:** Initial project structure with `wrangler.toml`, basic Worker setup, and Durable Object scaffolding.

### Prompt 2: Dependency Resolution
```
The project fails to build because the "agents" package doesn't exist. 
Refactor the code to:
1. Remove the external "agents" dependency
2. Implement a native Durable Object with SQLite storage
3. Maintain all existing functionality
```

**Result:** Refactored `agent.js` to use native Durable Objects API with built-in SQLite storage.

---

## Core Features Development

### Prompt 3: Intent Analysis with AI
```
Implement an intent analysis function that:
1. Uses Workers AI with Llama 3.3 70B Instruct
2. Analyzes user messages to determine intent (create_task, list_tasks, etc.)
3. Extracts relevant parameters from natural language
4. Falls back to heuristic parsing if AI fails
5. Returns structured JSON with type and parameters
```

**Result:** `analyzeIntent()` method in `agent.js` with AI-first approach and heuristic fallback.

**Actual Prompt Used in Code:**
```javascript
const prompt = `Analyze this user message and return ONLY a valid JSON object.

Message: "${message}"

Return format:
{"type": "intent_type", "parameters": {...}}

Valid types: create_task, list_tasks, update_task, complete_task, delete_task, 
schedule_tasks, analyze_productivity, get_suggestions, general

Examples:
"Create a task to buy milk" -> {"type":"create_task","parameters":{"title":"buy milk"}}
"Show pending tasks" -> {"type":"list_tasks","parameters":{"status":"pending"}}
"Complete task 3" -> {"type":"complete_task","parameters":{"task_id":3}}

Return ONLY the JSON, no explanation:`;
```

### Prompt 4: Task Management Logic
```
Create comprehensive task management methods:
- createTask: Extract title, description, priority, due date, tags from parameters
- listTasks: Support filtering by status, priority, limit
- updateTask: Allow partial updates with automatic timestamp
- completeTask: Mark task as completed
- deleteTask: Remove task from storage
- scheduleTasks: Sort by priority and deadline
- analyzeProductivity: Generate stats and insights
```

**Result:** Full CRUD implementation in `agent.js` with emoji-rich responses.

### Prompt 5: Productivity Analysis
```
Generate an AI-powered productivity analysis that:
1. Calculates completion rate, pending tasks, priority breakdown
2. Provides encouraging feedback based on completion rate
3. Uses Workers AI to generate personalized insights
4. Falls back to static tips if AI unavailable
```

**Result:** `analyzeProductivity()` and `getTaskSuggestions()` methods with AI integration.

## UI/UX Enhancement

### Prompt 6: Modern Chat Interface
```
Create a beautiful, modern chat interface with:
- Gradient purple/blue design matching the brand
- Message bubbles for user and assistant
- Quick example prompts as clickable chips
- Loading states and error handling
- Keyboard support (Enter to send)
- Auto-scrolling message container
- Back button to home page
```

**Result:** `getChatPage()` function with responsive CSS and interactive JavaScript.

### Prompt 7: Home Page Demo Integration
```
The home page has a demo input field and a "Start Chatting with AI" button.
When users type in the demo field and click the button, the text should:
1. Be passed to the chat page as a URL parameter
2. Auto-populate the chat input field
3. Automatically send the message after 500ms delay
```

**Result:** Updated home page with query parameter passing and chat page auto-send logic.

### Prompt 8: Voice Control UI
```
Design a voice control interface featuring:
- Large circular microphone button (150px)
- Pulsing animation when recording
- Status messages (ready, recording, processing)
- Real-time transcription display
- Response area with styling
- Web Audio API integration for microphone access
- Base64 audio encoding for API transmission
```

**Result:** Complete voice control page with modern UI and microphone recording functionality.

### Prompt 9: Workflows Dashboard
```
Instead of showing raw JSON for workflows, create an interactive dashboard with:
- Grid layout with responsive cards
- Each workflow has: icon, name, description, trigger button
- Real-time status feedback (loading, success, error)
- Auto-hide success messages after 5 seconds
- Beautiful hover effects and animations
```

**Result:** `getWorkflowsPage()` function with 4 workflow cards and interactive triggers.

## Workflows Implementation

### Prompt 10: Workflow System Architecture
```
Implement a workflow system for task automation:
1. Daily reminder - summarize today's tasks by priority
2. Productivity report - weekly stats with AI insights
3. Auto-schedule - sort pending tasks optimally
4. Priority review - suggest priority adjustments for old tasks

Each workflow should:
- Access the Durable Object agent
- Query task data from SQLite
- Generate formatted reports
- Store results in conversation history
```

**Result:** `TaskWorkflow` class in `workflows.js` with 4 automated workflows.

### Prompt 11: Workflow API Endpoints
```
Create REST endpoints for workflow triggers:
- GET /workflows - List all available workflows
- POST /workflows/daily-reminder - Trigger daily reminder
- POST /workflows/productivity-report - Generate report
- POST /workflows/auto-schedule - Auto-schedule tasks
- POST /workflows/priority-review - Review priorities

Each should instantiate TaskWorkflow and call run() method.
```

**Result:** `handleWorkflowsAPI()` function with full workflow routing.

---

## Voice Control Integration

### Prompt 12: Voice Input Handler
```
Implement voice input processing:
1. Accept base64-encoded audio in POST request
2. Simulate speech-to-text (prepare for Deepgram integration)
3. Process transcribed text through chat endpoint
4. Return transcription and AI response
5. Include placeholder for TTS audio URL
```

**Result:** `handleVoiceInput()` function with STT simulation and chat integration.

### Prompt 13: Voice Integration Guide
```
Document how to integrate real STT/TTS services:
- Deepgram for speech-to-text
- ElevenLabs for text-to-speech
- Include code examples and API key setup
- Explain environment variable configuration
```

**Result:** Documentation in README.md and code comments with integration examples.

---

## Deployment & Testing

### Prompt 14: Cloudflare Services Setup
```
Create the required Cloudflare services:
1. Vectorize index with 1024 dimensions and cosine metric
2. KV namespace for TASK_STORE
3. Update wrangler.toml with correct bindings
4. Configure Durable Objects with new_sqlite_classes for free tier
```

**Result:** Successful service creation and configuration updates.

### Prompt 15: Error Resolution
```
Fix deployment errors:
1. "agents" package not found -> Refactor to native implementation
2. Duplicate fetch handler -> Consolidate into single handler
3. Durable Object migration error -> Use new_sqlite_classes
4. Template literal syntax error -> Fix escaped backticks
5. Workflows package missing -> Implement custom workflow system
```

**Result:** All build errors resolved, successful deployment.

### Prompt 16: Testing & Verification
```
Test all endpoints:
- Health check: /health
- Chat: POST /chat with test messages
- Tasks: GET /tasks, POST /tasks, PUT /tasks/:id
- Workflows: GET /workflows, POST /workflows/*
- Voice: GET /voice (UI), POST /voice (API)
```

**Result:** All endpoints verified working in production.

## Optimization Prompts

### Prompt 17: Performance Optimization
```
Optimize the AI task manager:
1. Add heuristic fallback for common intents (avoid AI calls)
2. Cache frequently accessed tasks
3. Minimize AI token usage with concise prompts
4. Use async/await properly for parallel operations
```

**Result:** Hybrid approach with heuristics + AI for optimal performance and cost.

### Prompt 18: Error Handling Enhancement
```
Improve error handling across the application:
1. Wrap all AI calls in try-catch
2. Provide meaningful error messages to users
3. Log errors for debugging
4. Implement graceful degradation (fallbacks)
```

**Result:** Comprehensive error handling in all functions.

- Setup instructions (step-by-step)
- Local development guide
- API usage examples
- Architecture diagram
- Troubleshooting section
- Future enhancements
- License and contact info
```

**Result:** Complete README.md with all sections and examples.

### Prompt 20: PROMPTS.md Documentation
